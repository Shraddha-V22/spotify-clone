# spotify-clone

Spotify clone with the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/discover/) using VanillaJs, Vite and Tailwind CSS. 

working on adding more features.

-----
By default only those users which I have added in the developer dashboard are allowed to access the app. I have not yet applied for quota extension mode.
So, If a user wants to use this app, I will need to add their email id to give them the access.
